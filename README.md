# Binary Reader/Writer
This package contains BinaryReader and BinaryWriter classes for TypeScript.

This library is inspired by [io.js](https://github.com/Kuree/ts-sims4/blob/master/src/io.ts) file from Kuree's TypeScript library for the Sims 4. It used to be basically that verbatim, but has since been modified and rewritten quite extensively.
